## Personal Accomplishments:

### Participated in the Buddy Up Game Jam: Winter 2023
After being assigned the role of "Production Manager", I put my effort into developing relationships with the rest of the team, and figuring out how I could play a supporting role in the development of our game.
I quickly realized that we had a great team, but no organization, so I put together a scrum board for the team to document features that needed to be developed, art and audio that needed to be created, as well as writing that needed to be done. I also created separate channels in our group chat so that the development chatter could be contained to various aspects of the game, such as code, art, audio, and storyline/writing.

Having spent a good portion of my professional time fighting with, and taking these tools for granted, this game jam experience really drove home the utility that these tools provide a team.

The need for a mediator and manager was also quickly realized, as people don't always figure out healthy and supportive ways of communicating and working with each other right away. My background in management was extremely helpful in these times, as I was able to recognize the need, and bring the skills needed to the table to navigate difficult emotions from multiple people, and align everyone towards the same goal, in ways that give everyone the opportunity to do their best work.

At the end of the 3 weeks, we had created a finished, (mostly-working) game, that we were proud to present, which was all we could ask for as a team of ~10 first-time game jammers.

### Released my own game
In an effort to better learn hosting, authentication, and database management, I decided to create a game.
Using Typescript, Firebase hosting/authentication, and Firebase's database (Firestore), I released a web game, playable by anyone.

In the process of developing items, characters, and locations for the game, all of which needed their own icons, I made the VERY CONTROVERSIAL decision to utilize an AI art tool.
I learned how, and why, to self-host an instance of Stable Diffusion. I learned what models are, and how to use/train different models. I spent many hours practicing my prompts, both image-to-image prompts, as well as text-to-image prompts. Using this, I created many icons for the game's items, characters, and locations.

Take a look at the code here:

This exercise taught me a lot about hosting, version control, database manipulation, UI/UX, and gameplay loops.


### Created a Spotify Playlist web app
I listen to music a lot. I'm typically listening to music while I work, while I cook, while I garden, etc.
A problem I found myself facing quite frequently was what to listen to. Spotify gives you daily mixes that list four or five artists they include, which sometimes got me excited to listen to those artists, only to find a song or two by each of them.
In an effort to solve this problem, I created an app that searches Spotify for artists, and allows you to select up to five. Once you have your artists selected, you can generate a playlist.
Using an algorithm I created, the app will select a number of songs by, or including, each artist you provided, I call them "seed artists", and will create a playlist in your library that is 80% "seed artist" songs, and 20% recommendations based off of those selected artists.

This app has allowed my partner, a handful of friends, and I, the ability to select a handful of artists we're feeling like listening to that day, and create a very quick, on the fly, playlist that has a "vibe" we were going for.
The app, Blendify, is currently in Spotify's app review process, and has the possibility of being a publicly available app.
As of writing this Jan 24th, 2024, the app is not yet approved, and so it only allows 25 users I approve.

If the app has been approved, you will be able to use it here:
